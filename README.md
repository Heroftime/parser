# Parser program

The main purpose of this program is to receive a log file and calculate two things:
- Total views of every page
- Total unique views of every page

## Prerequisites

The only requirement to run this program is to have ruby installed.

## How to run?

1. Clone or download this repo into your system
2. Run the tests: ```ruby tc_parser.rb```
3. There are two ways to run the program:
    1. One without any argument (This will give total views per page): ```ruby main.rb``` 
    2. With the argument ```unique``` (This will give unique views per page ): ```ruby main.rb unique```
